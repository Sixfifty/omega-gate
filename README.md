Yet another goat simulator clone, just ignore it.

## How to run
Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and then open up your terminal of choice, visit the project root and type:
`vagrant up`

This will create a VM with the software installed, you can view it at:

[http://192.168.33.28](http://192.168.33.28/)

To suspend the VM, just run `vagrant suspend` or type `vagrant destroy`to get rid of it completely.

If you need SSH access just run `vagrant ssh`.
